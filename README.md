# SIFT-Based-Image-Stitching
This repository implements a robust computer vision pipeline for aligning and stitching overlapping image pairs. It utilizes SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for feature extraction and Homography estimation to map images into a shared coordinate system.

## 🔧 Key Algorithms & Techniques

- **Feature Extraction:**  
  SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to detect robust keypoints invariant to scale and rotation.

- **Feature Matching:**  
  Brute-Force Matcher (BFMatcher) with KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) for initial correspondence.

- **Outlier Rejection:**  
  Lowe’s Ratio Test to filter weak matches and **RANSAC** to compute a robust Homography matrix, eliminating false positives.

- **Image Warping:**  
  Perspective transformation using the calculated Homography matrix to align the secondary image to the anchor reference frame.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Expansion to **N-image mosaicking** using cumulative homography chains.  
- Implementation of **multi-band blending** to reduce seam artifacts.
